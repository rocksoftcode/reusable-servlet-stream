The purpose of these classes is to allow the reading of a request's body, upstream of a controller that will also read the request's body.  Without this, Spring will throw nasty exceptions about the stream already having been read. 

The easiest thing to do here is to simply lift the Servlet Filter and the Servlet Stream implementation.  If you'd like to play around with the Filter and controller, it's a Spring Boot app. You can simply run the integration test to see how it works.  If you'd like to mess around with a REST client, the server can be started via the TestApp class, or started via Gradle with the "bootRun" task.
