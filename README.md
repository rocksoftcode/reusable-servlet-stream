The easiest thing to do here is to simply life the Servlet Filter and the Servlet Stream implementation.  If you'd like to play around with the Filter and controller, it's a Spring Boot app. You can simply run the integration test to see how it works.  If you'd like to mess around with a REST client, the server can be started via the TestApp class, or started via Gradle with the "bootRun" task.
